DESCRIPTION					       *asciinema-description*

This filetype plugin provides settings, commands, and syntax highlighting for
asciinema terminal session recordings (*.cast) in order to tweak and enhance
the recording.
						       *asciinema-timeoffsets*
The v2 format uses absolute timestamps (in fractional seconds), so additional
tools are needed to add more delay or speed up sections, and multiple
recordings cannot simply be concatenated.
[2.56533, "o", "a"] ~
[2.676512, "o", "b"] ~
[2.756698, "o", "c"] ~
This plugin facilitates manual edits by adding a new first column with a +0.42
relative offset, which then takes precedence over the following original
absolute time when writing the buffer:
[+2.56533 ,   2.56533 , "o", "a"] ~
[+0.111182,   2.676512, "o", "b"] ~
[+0.080186,   2.756698, "o", "c"] ~
By editing the relative offset, durations can be shortened or prolonged
easily. If you want the adaptation to stop at a certain record, simply remove
the added first column; the absolute timestamp will be used (if necessary
increased to avoid a jump back into the past).

USAGE							     *asciinema-usage*

						      *:AsciinemaInsertMarker*
:AsciinemaInsertMarker [{label}]
			Insert a specific point on a recording's timeline,
			which can be used for navigation within the recording
			or to automate the player. It's inserted after the
			current record and appears at the same time.
					     *:AsciinemaInsertCommentAtCursor*
:AsciinemaInsertCommentAtCursor {comment}
			Insert a comment at the recording's current cursor
			position. It will appear after the current record and
			does not modify the cursor position, so any following
			records will overwrite it (unless they jump
			elsewhere).
				    *:AsciinemaInsertCommentAndMarkerAtCursor*
:AsciinemaInsertCommentAndMarkerAtCursor {comment}
			Insert both a marker and comment at the recording's
			current cursor position, to provide commentary on
			what's about to happen and allow to navigate to it.
					*:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAtCursor*
			       *:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAndMarkerAtCursor*
:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAtCursor {comment}
:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAndMarkerAtCursor {comment}
			Insert a comment at the recording's current cursor
			position, and clear it again after
			|g:asciinema_TimedCommentDuration|. Following records
			are kept untouched, so this increases the overall
			duration of the recording.
					*:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAtCursor*
			       *:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAndMarkerAtCursor*
:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAtCursor {comment}
:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAndMarkerAtCursor {comment}
			Insert a comment at the recording's current cursor
			position, and clear it again before the next record
			happens (but show it no longer than
			|g:asciinema_TimedCommentDuration|). The delay between
			the current and the following record is reduced
			accordingly.
					   *:AsciinemaInsertCommentAtPosition*
				  *:AsciinemaInsertCommentAndMarkerAtPosition*
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaInsertCommentAtPosition {comment}
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaInsertCommentAndMarkerAtPosition {comment}
			Insert a comment at {row}, {col} (first column if
			omitted) or |g:asciinema_DefaultPosition| if no
			address is given. It will appear after the current
			record and does not permanently change the cursor
			position, so any following records will continue as if
			it weren't there.
				      *:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAtPosition*
			     *:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAndMarkerAtPosition*
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAtPosition {comment}
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAndMarkerAtPosition {comment}
			Insert a comment at {row}, {col} (first column if
			omitted) or |g:asciinema_DefaultPosition| if no
			address is given, and clear it again after
			|g:asciinema_TimedCommentDuration|. Following records
			are kept untouched, so this increases the overall
			duration of the recording.
				      *:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAtPosition*
			     *:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAndMarkerAtPosition*
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAtPosition {comment}
:[{row}[,{col}]]AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAndMarkerAtPosition {comment}
			Insert a comment at {row}, {col} (first column if
			omitted) or |g:asciinema_DefaultPosition| if no
			address is given, and clear it again before the next
			record happens (but show it no longer than
			|g:asciinema_TimedCommentDuration|). The delay
			between the current and the following record is
			reduced accordingly.

EXAMPLE							   *asciinema-example*

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					      *asciinema-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-asciinema
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim asciinema*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					      *asciinema-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.2 or higher with |+float| support.
- Requires Vim 8.1.560 or higher for the :Asciinema*AtPosition commands.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.046 or
  higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					     *asciinema-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
		       *g:asciinema_CommentPrefix* *g:asciinema_CommentSuffix*
Text that is inserted before / after the passed {comment}; e.g. quotes and/or
ANSI escape sequences for highlighting.
					    *g:asciinema_TimedCommentDuration*
Duration in seconds that a timed comment is shown before it's cleared again.
					 *g:asciinema_TimedCommentMinDuration*
Minimum duration in seconds to the next record that
|:AsciinemaInsertTimedCommentAtCursor| et al. accept, so that the comment is
actually readable. Use |:AsciinemaExtendTimedCommentAtCursor| et al. if the
next record follows too quickly.
						 *g:asciinema_DefaultPosition*
The default row, col for the |:AsciinemaInsertCommentAtPosition| commands; the
default is the terminal's upper left corner: >
    let g:asciinema_DefaultPosition = [1, 1]
<
